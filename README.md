## What is Design Process?

Design is a systematic creative process that helps you discover and create meaningful solutions in your life, in your community, in your school or university and in yor workplace. Over the past decade design thinking has become a term used to describe many different things. Design thinking emerges from the writings of Herbert A. Simon (<a href="http://amzn.to/2odcjwm">The Sciences of the Artificial</a>, 1969), Robert McKim (<a href="http://amzn.to/2oQNRSI">Experiences in Visual Thinking</a>, 1973), Bryan Lawson (<a href="http://amzn.to/2nsRvly">How Designers Think</a>, 1980) and ultimately Peter Rowe in his book <a href="http://amzn.to/2oUtJw0">Design Thinking </a>,1987. It was popularized by the work of <a href="https://www.ideo.com/">IDEO</a> and the <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/">Stanford d.school</a>.

Here is a great article "<a href="http://web.mit.edu/jrankin/www/engin_as_lib_art/Design_thinking.pdf">Wicked Problems in Design Thinking</a>" on the subject by Richard Buchanan.


I created this site as a way to build a resource to tools, methods and examples of how art and creativity can lead innovation in the tech and social sectors.

For more information on ways you can learn design thinking, innovation, interaction design and a wide variety of creative and technical skills check out the <a href="http://multimedia.csueastbay.edu/">Multimedia Graduate program at CSU East Bay</a>, where I teach.
